"""
Domain B — Streaks & Insights.

Computes current streak, longest streak, and completion rate
from check-in history.  Persists milestone events (7/14/30-day)
to the milestones table.

Handles daily habits (every day counts) and custom habits (only certain weekdays count)

The streak functions never touch the database: they get a {date: count}
dict (from habits.service.checkins_by_date) plus the habit's settings.
Only the milestone functions use `db`, and only the milestones table
(milestones_for_user also joins habits, to find the user's habits).

Note for self:
fetchone() -> returns one habit or none
fetchall() -> returns all habits as a list
